Let it be said, despite consistant growth in revenues, one of the world's first true Software companies, Microsoft, is on the decline after 30+ years of success. True that still nearly 90% of Desktops run Windows, it's no longer the most profitable segment. Today <strong>Mobile first</strong> is the game changer; and MS missed the moment. About a million Android devices are activated everyday, while Apple sold 70+ millions iPhones in 2014 Q4, MS' windows phone doesn't sell like hot cakes. On the server side, it's Linux that runs the world's ICT infrastructure; from Google, Facebook and other major tech giants' data centers to web hosting providers. So how MS could stay relevant in the coming years ? Well, the new CEO, <a href="http://news.microsoft.com/ceo/index.html" target="_blank">Satya Nadella</a> seems to have clues.
<ul>
	<li>First the .NET framework has been open sourced - and can superseed Mono if ported to other OSes</li>
	<li>MS' mobile apps are being ported to iOS and Android</li>
	<li>The latest Visual Studio IDE can build apps for other platforms</li>
	<li>yes, if you cannot beat them, be their friend!</li>
</ul>
A few years back, virtualization code has been contributed to the Linux kernel for running Windows Server on KVM. But to really stay in the game, I believe MS should either revive the Lindows OS, fully embrace Linux and Open Source. Imagine the API, look and feel of the Desktop ported to the Linux Kernel: no more viruses, no more frequent restarts after updates and more power to end users!
